          "question": "What is COIN100 (C100)?",
          "answer": "C100 is a decentralized index fund token on Polygon, designed to track the total market cap of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. It uses a rebasing mechanism to adjust balances proportionally as the market cap changes."
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "question": "How does C100 track the top 100 crypto market cap?",
          "answer": "C100 periodically adjusts its total supply through a 'rebase' based on the top 100 crypto market cap. When the total market cap changes, the supply of C100 changes proportionally, ensuring each holder maintains their fractional ownership of the index."
        },
        {
          "id": 24,
          "question": "How do I store C100?",

          "id": 6,
          "question": "What is the initial supply of C100?",
          "answer": "The initial supply equals the initial top 100 crypto market cap (represented in C100 units). This anchors the token’s value to the index from inception."
        },
        {
          "id": 7,
          "question": "What is the reference price at launch?",
          "answer": "Initially, the owner sets a reference rate by adding liquidity to a DEX. Over time, the market finds its price. With the new polRate mechanism, the public sale can reference pool prices, ensuring dynamic market-driven pricing."
        },
        {
          "id": 23,
          "question": "Does C100 pay dividends?",
          "answer": "No. C100 doesn’t pay dividends directly. Value accrues because your share of the total index remains constant, adjusting with the top 100 market cap."
        },
        {
          "id": 40,
          "question": "Is C100 inflationary?",
          "answer": "C100 isn’t traditionally inflationary or deflationary. Its supply rebases to reflect the total index value. Everyone’s share remains constant, even as total supply shifts."
        },
        {
          "id": 57,
          "question": "Is there a limit to how large the top 100 crypto market cap can grow?",

        },
        {
          "id": 59,
          "question": "Does the composition of the top 100 matter for holders?",
          "answer": "Not directly. Holders benefit from the aggregate performance of the top 100. Whether coins enter or leave the top 100, your share still represents the same fraction of the total cap."
        },
        {
          "id": 60,
          "question": "What if the top 100 changes (some coins leave, others enter)?",

        },
        {
          "id": 101,
          "question": "How are liquidity providers rewarded?",
          "answer": "Liquidity providers receive a configurable percentage of the supply changes during rebases as rewards. This incentivizes providing liquidity and ensures a healthy trading environment."
        },
        {
          "id": 102,
          "question": "What is the LP reward percentage?",
          "answer": "The LP reward percentage is a configurable parameter (initially up to 10%) of supply expansions allocated to liquidity pools. Governance can adjust this percentage."

        {
          "id": 8,
          "question": "What does rebase mean?",
          "answer": "A rebase adjusts all token balances proportionally to mirror changes in the total top 100 crypto market cap. It ensures your fractional share of the index remains constant."
        },
        {
          "id": 9,
          "question": "Who initiates the rebase initially?",

          "id": 96,
          "question": "What if no one calls rebase?",
          "answer": "Then no index update occurs and market price may drift. Eventually, the community can implement autonomous or time-locked rebase calls."
        },
        {
          "id": 103,
          "question": "How is the polRate updated during rebases?",
          "answer": "During each rebase, the C100 contract fetches the latest polRate from liquidity pools. This updated polRate is then pushed to the PublicSale contract, ensuring that the rate remains aligned with current market conditions."
        },
        {
          "id": 104,
          "question": "Can the polRate be updated without a rebase?",
          "answer": "No. polRate updates are tied to rebase calls. When a rebase occurs, the contract reads from the pools and updates polRate accordingly."
