          "id": 1,
          "question": "What is COIN100 (C100)?",
          "answer": "COIN100 (C100) is a decentralized cryptocurrency index fund built on the Polygon network. It represents the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, mirroring the performance of the overall crypto market. Inspired by traditional index funds like the S&P 500, C100 provides diversified, market-wide exposure to the crypto industry without requiring active portfolio management from investors."
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "question": "How does C100 track the top 100 crypto market cap?",
          "answer": "C100 utilizes a global rebasing mechanism that periodically adjusts the total supply based on the top 100 crypto market capitalization. When the total market cap changes, the supply of C100 changes proportionally, ensuring each holder maintains their fractional ownership of the index."
        },
        {
          "id": 3,
          "question": "Is C100 an ERC20 token?",
          "answer": "Yes, C100 follows the ERC20 standard with additional logic for rebasing, fee splitting between the treasury and liquidity pool, and integration points for future governance."
        },
        {
          "id": 4,
          "question": "On which network is C100 deployed?",
          "answer": "C100 is deployed on the Polygon (MATIC) network for low gas fees, high throughput, and efficient, cost-effective transactions."
        },
        {
          "id": 5,
          "question": "Why Polygon?",
          "answer": "Polygon offers low transaction fees, quick confirmations, and a growing ecosystem of DeFi protocols, making it an ideal environment for C100."
        },
        {
          "id": 6,
          "question": "What is the initial supply of C100?",
          "answer": "The initial supply equals the initial top 100 crypto market cap, denominated in C100 units. This anchors the token’s value to the index from inception."
        },
        {
          "id": 7,
          "question": "What is the reference price at launch?",
          "answer": "During the presale period, C100 tokens are sold at a fixed rate of 1 C100 = 0.001 USDC. This fixed pricing ensures stability and predictability for early investors."
        },
        {
          "id": 8,
          "question": "What does rebase mean?",
          "answer": "Rebase is a mechanism that adjusts all token balances proportionally to reflect changes in the total market capitalization of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. This ensures that each holder's fractional share of the index remains constant."
        },
        {
          "id": 9,
          "question": "Who initiates the rebase initially?",
          "answer": "Initially, admins can call the rebase function to adjust the supply based on market cap updates. Over time, governance or automated oracles can take over to ensure a trust-minimized process."
        },
        {
          "id": 10,
          "question": "Will there be automated rebasing eventually?",
          "answer": "Yes, once governance and oracles are established, rebasing can be automated to ensure continuous and reliable supply adjustments without manual intervention."

          "id": 11,
          "question": "How is the total supply adjusted during a rebase?",
          "answer": "During a rebase, the total supply is adjusted based on the new market capitalization. The `gonsPerFragment` scaling factor is updated to ensure that each holder's balance scales proportionally, maintaining their fractional ownership."
        },
        {
          "id": 12,
          "question": "What is `gonsPerFragment`?",
          "answer": "`gonsPerFragment` is an internal scaling factor that efficiently adjusts balances during rebases. It ensures that when the total supply changes, individual balances remain consistent with their proportional ownership."
        },
        {
          "id": 13,
          "question": "How is the current price of C100 determined?",
          "answer": "During the presale period, the price is fixed at 0.001 USDC per C100. Post-presale, the price is determined by the single liquidity pool (C100/USDC) on a decentralized exchange, reflecting market dynamics."
        },
        {
          "id": 14,
          "question": "What happens if there is no liquidity pool set?",
          "answer": "If no liquidity pool is set, transaction fees allocated to the liquidity pool are redirected entirely to the treasury, ensuring that fees are still collected and utilized effectively."
        },
        {
          "id": 15,
          "question": "How secure is the rebasing mechanism?",
          "answer": "The rebasing mechanism is governed by decentralized governance and audited smart contracts. OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20` and `ReentrancyGuard` are used to enhance security and prevent common vulnerabilities."
        },
        {
          "id": 16,
          "question": "Can the smart contracts be upgraded?",
          "answer": "While the contracts are designed to be immutable post-deployment, governance can propose and implement new contracts or features, ensuring adaptability while maintaining security."
        },
        {
          "id": 17,
          "question": "Does C100 support meta-transactions or gasless transactions?",
          "answer": "Currently, C100 does not support meta-transactions. All transactions require POL (MATIC) for gas fees. Future updates or governance proposals may introduce such features."
        },
        {
          "id": 18,
          "question": "How are smart contract interactions handled?",
          "answer": "Smart contract interactions, such as buying tokens or participating in governance, are facilitated through standard Ethereum transactions on the Polygon network. Users can interact via compatible wallets like MetaMask."
        },
        {
          "id": 19,
          "question": "Are there any limitations on the number of rebases?",
          "answer": "There is no inherent limit to the number of rebases. Rebases occur based on the predefined frequency and are executed as long as market cap data is available and governance allows."
        },
        {
          "id": 20,
          "question": "What happens if the Polygon network experiences high congestion?",
          "answer": "While Polygon is designed for high throughput and low fees, extreme congestion could delay transactions, including rebases. Governance and technical teams monitor network health to mitigate such issues."

        {
          "id": 23,
          "question": "How are liquidity providers rewarded?",
          "answer": "Liquidity providers receive a fixed 1% fee from each transaction, incentivizing them to provide liquidity to the C100/USDC pool. This ensures deep liquidity, reduces slippage, and fosters a robust trading environment."
        },
        {
          "id": 24,
          "question": "Is there a maximum supply cap for C100?",
          "answer": "No, there is no hard cap. The supply of C100 floats with the total market capitalization of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, expanding or contracting proportionally."
        },
        {
          "id": 25,
          "question": "Can I redeem my C100 tokens for underlying assets?",
          "answer": "No, C100 is a synthetic index token. It does not provide direct claims on underlying assets but represents proportional exposure to the top 100 crypto market cap."
        },
        {
          "id": 26,
          "question": "How is the initial market cap determined?",

          "id": 36,
          "question": "How does the rebase mechanism work?",
          "answer": "The rebase mechanism adjusts the total supply of C100 based on the new market capitalization of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. This is done by updating the `gonsPerFragment` scaling factor, which proportionally adjusts each holder's balance without altering their fractional ownership."
        },

        {
          "id": 39,
          "question": "What ensures fairness during rebases?",
          "answer": "Every holder's balance changes by the same ratio during a rebase, ensuring that no single participant is advantaged or disadvantaged. This maintains proportional ownership across the entire supply."

          "id": 42,
          "question": "What happens if no one calls rebase?",
          "answer": "If rebases are not called, the index won't update, and the token price may drift from its intended reference. Governance and automated oracle systems are planned to handle this scenario by ensuring regular and reliable rebases."

          "id": 43,
          "question": "How is the new supply calculated during a rebase?",
          "answer": "The new supply is calculated by multiplying the old supply by the ratio of the new market cap to the old market cap. This ensures that the total supply accurately reflects the current market capitalization of the top 100 cryptocurrencies."
