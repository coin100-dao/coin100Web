## Introduction
COIN100 (C100) is a decentralized cryptocurrency index fund built on the Polygon network. It represents the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, mirroring the performance of the overall crypto market. Inspired by traditional index funds like the S&P 500, C100 provides a diversified, market-wide exposure to the crypto industry without requiring active portfolio management from investors.

## Problem Statement
The crypto market can be volatile and fragmented. Investors seeking broad exposure face challenges in selecting and maintaining a balanced portfolio of top assets. Without a simple mechanism to track the aggregate performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, investors may either miss growth opportunities or take on unnecessary risk.

## Solution: COIN100 (C100) Token
C100 solves these challenges by:
- Offering a token that represents a proportional share of the top 100 crypto market cap.
- Automatically adjusting each holder’s balance through global rebases as the top 100 market cap changes.
- Reducing complexity for investors who want broad market exposure without active rebalancing.

## Key Principles and Features

### Fairness and Equal Treatment of Holders
Every holder’s balance scales proportionally with changes in the total market cap. No single participant is advantaged or disadvantaged during rebases.

### Global Rebase Mechanism
On each upkeep call, the total supply adjusts to reflect the updated top 100 crypto market cap. All balances scale equally, maintaining each holder’s fractional ownership.

### Manual Upkeep in Initial Phase
Early on, the owner will manually call the rebase function with updated market cap figures. Over time, this process can transition to an automated system (e.g., via a governance proposal and oracle integration).

### No Complex Public Sale Mechanics
C100 emphasizes simplicity in its public sale to ensure broad accessibility and ease of participation for all investors.

### Liquidity Provider Incentives
To ensure a healthy trading environment and stable liquidity, C100 introduces incentives for liquidity providers. Liquidity providers are rewarded with a 10% share of the total transaction fees generated during the public sale. This mechanism encourages liquidity provision, reducing price volatility and enhancing the trading experience for all users.

## Tokenomics

### Initial Parameters
- **Total Supply:** Equal to the initial top 100 crypto market cap (denominated in C100 units).
- **Initial Price:** Approximately $1 per C100 token, assuming pairing with a stable asset in a DEX.

### Distribution (Owner Allocation & ICO)
- **Owner Allocation:** 3% of total supply is retained by the owner for development, liquidity provision, and other strategic purposes.
- **ICO Allocation:** 97% of total supply is allocated for the Initial Coin Offering (ICO), enabling widespread distribution and community participation.

### Rebase Formula ("Genius" Formula)
**ratio = M_new / M_old**  
- **New Supply = Old Supply * ratio**  
- Every holder’s balance is multiplied by the same ratio.

This ensures fair and transparent tracking of the market cap changes.

### Market Dynamics and Price Stability
If the market cap doubles, all balances double, maintaining the token’s value reference. As the community matures and markets become more efficient, the token price should remain stable around its baseline in response to these proportional adjustments.

### Liquidity Provider Rewards
A dedicated 10% of the total transaction fees generated during the public sale is allocated as rewards to liquidity providers. This incentivizes users to provide liquidity, ensuring deep liquidity pools, reducing slippage, and fostering a robust trading environment. Rewards are distributed proportionally based on the amount of liquidity each provider contributes.

## Technical Architecture

### Polygon Network
Deployed on Polygon for low gas fees and high throughput, ensuring efficient and cost-effective transactions for users.

### C100 Token Contract
Implements ERC20 standards, rebase logic, ownership control, pause/unpause functionalities, and integration points for future governance.

### ICO (Public Sale) Contract
Handles the initial distribution of 97% tokens. Investors purchase C100 with POL or ERC20 tokens (e.g., USDC) during the ICO period. Unsold tokens are burned at the end, ensuring only the circulating supply reflects real participants. Additionally, during the ICO, a 10% reward is allocated to liquidity providers from the transaction fees to incentivize liquidity provisioning.

### Scaling and GonsPerFragment
Balances are tracked in a large integer unit called “gons.” The global `gonsPerFragment` variable determines how these translate into user balances. On rebase, adjusting `gonsPerFragment` updates everyone’s balance proportionally in O(1) complexity.

## Governance

### Transition from Owner to Governor
Initially, the owner manages the contract. Later, a governor contract can be introduced. The governor can propose and vote on changes (parameters, treasury usage, etc.), enabling community-driven evolution.

### Future Governor Contract
By deploying a governor contract and timelock controller, the project gradually moves towards full decentralization. Governance token holders can vote on upgrades, new features, or parameter changes (e.g., adjusting the rebase frequency or introducing a treasury fee).

### Community Involvement
Over time, the community will shape the project’s future. They can propose:
- Adjusting parameters (fees, rebase frequency)
- Allocating treasury funds for development, marketing, or liquidity
- Introducing new features or improvements
- Managing liquidity provider reward percentages

## Security

### Ownership Controls
The `onlyAdmin` modifiers ensure that only authorized parties can make critical changes, safeguarding the contract against unauthorized modifications.

### Pause/Unpause Mechanisms
The contract can be paused in emergencies, preventing transfers and safeguarding against exploits during uncertain times.

### Reentrancy Guards
NonReentrant modifiers protect against complex reentrancy attacks, ensuring safe execution of functions like buying tokens or rebasing.

### Audits and Best Practices
Smart contract auditing and community code reviews will enhance trust and security. Following industry standards, best practices, and thorough testing before mainnet deployment is crucial.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1:** Token and ICO launch, manual upkeep.
- **Phase 2:** Introduce governance, set governor contract.
- **Phase 3:** Integrate oracles for automated updates.
- **Phase 4:** Community-driven proposals for enhancements, treasury usage, fee adjustments.
- **Phase 5:** Implement liquidity provider reward mechanisms, scaling, and ecosystem expansion.
- **Phase 6:** Ongoing refinement, security audits, and feature additions based on community feedback.

## ICO Plan (Simplicity-Focused)

### ICO Parameters
- **Duration:** 12 months.
- **Accepted Currencies:** POL, optionally USDC.
- **Rate:** Fixed C100 per POL/USDC.
- **Liquidity Provider Reward:** 10% of transaction fees allocated to liquidity providers during the ICO.

### During the ICO
- **Purchases:** Investors buy C100 directly from the crowdsale contract using POL or approved ERC20 tokens.
- **Rebase Operations:** Owner periodically calls rebase to keep C100 supply aligned with the top 100 market cap.
- **Liquidity Provision:** Liquidity providers contribute to the C100-POL liquidity pool and earn a 10% reward from transaction fees.

### Post-ICO Finalization and Burning Unsold Tokens
At the end of the ICO:
- **No More Purchases:** ICO phase concludes, preventing further token sales.
- **Burn Unsold Tokens:** Any unsold tokens are burned, ensuring the supply reflects only actively held tokens.

### Maintaining the Index Post-ICO
After the ICO:
- **Continuous Rebasing:** Continue daily/periodic rebases to adjust supply based on market cap changes.
- **Automated Upkeep:** Transition to automated rebase operations using oracles and governance decisions.
- **Governance Enhancements:** Introduce advanced features such as treasury management, automated liquidity rewards, and fee adjustments through community proposals.

### Liquidity Provider Participation During ICO
- **Incentives:** During the ICO, liquidity providers are rewarded with 10% of the total transaction fees generated.
- **Participation:** Anyone can become a liquidity provider by adding C100 and POL (MATIC) to supported DEXs.
- **Rewards Distribution:** Rewards are distributed proportionally based on the liquidity provided, ensuring fair compensation for contributions.
