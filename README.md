## Introduction

The cryptocurrency market is renowned for its volatility and rapid growth. However, navigating this landscape can be challenging for both new and seasoned investors. Traditional financial instruments like index funds have provided a balanced and diversified investment approach in conventional markets. Drawing inspiration from these, **COIN100 (C100)** emerges as a decentralized cryptocurrency index fund built on the Polygon network, aiming to offer a similar diversified and stable investment vehicle in the crypto space.

## Problem Statement

Investing in cryptocurrencies individually exposes investors to high volatility and risk associated with specific assets. Tracking and managing a diversified portfolio of top-performing cryptocurrencies manually is time-consuming and complex. Additionally, the lack of regulated and easily accessible index-based investment options in the crypto market limits opportunities for investors seeking balanced exposure.

## Solution: COIN100 (C100) Token

**COIN100 (C100)** addresses these challenges by offering a decentralized index fund that tracks the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. By holding C100 tokens, investors gain diversified exposure to the leading cryptocurrencies, mitigating the risks associated with individual asset volatility. Built on the Polygon network, C100 ensures low transaction fees, high scalability, and robust security.

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Overview

The COIN100 smart contract is built on Solidity ^0.8.28 and leverages OpenZeppelin libraries for ERC20 standards, pausing mechanisms, ownership controls, and reentrancy protection. It integrates with Uniswap V2 for liquidity management and Chainlink for reliable price feeds.

**Key Components:**

- **ERC20Pausable:** Enables pausing of token transfers in emergencies.
- **Ownable:** Provides ownership control for administrative functions.
- **ReentrancyGuard:** Protects against reentrancy attacks in critical functions.
- **Uniswap Integration:** Facilitates liquidity pool management and price discovery.
- **Chainlink Oracles:** Ensures accurate and tamper-proof price data.

### Price Feeds and Oracles

COIN100 utilizes Chainlink oracles to obtain real-time price data for MATIC/USD and C100/USD. This data is crucial for the dynamic rebase mechanism, ensuring that the token supply adjusts accurately based on the latest market conditions.

**Features:**

- **Reliable Data:** Chainlink ensures high-quality, decentralized price feeds.
- **Fallback Mechanism:** If the C100/USD feed is unavailable, the contract derives the price via MATIC/USD and liquidity pool reserves.
- **Decimals Handling:** Ensures price data is standardized to 6 decimals for consistency.

### Uniswap Integration

COIN100 integrates with Uniswap V2 to manage liquidity pools, enabling seamless token swaps and liquidity provisioning.

**Key Points:**

- **Initial Pair Creation:** Upon deployment, the contract creates a liquidity pair with WMATIC.
- **Eligible Pairs:** Only designated liquidity pools are eligible for reward distribution.
- **Liquidity Management:** The contract can add or remove eligible pairs, ensuring optimal liquidity and reward distribution.

## Governance

COIN100 employs a robust governance framework, allowing designated governors to propose and vote on key parameters such as fee structures, reward rates, and eligible liquidity pairs.

**Governance Features:**

- **Governor Role:** A designated address with administrative privileges, settable by the owner.
- **Proposal Mechanism:** Governors can propose changes to contract parameters.
- **Voting Rights:** Token holders can participate in governance by voting on proposals, ensuring decentralized decision-making.
- **Transparency:** All governance actions are recorded on-chain, providing full transparency to the community.

## Security

Security is paramount for COIN100, ensuring the safety of funds and the integrity of the smart contract.

**Security Measures:**

- **Pausing Mechanism:** The contract can be paused in emergencies to prevent malicious activities.
- **Ownership Controls:** Only authorized addresses can perform sensitive operations.
- **Reentrancy Protection:** Critical functions are protected against reentrancy attacks using OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`.
- **Thorough Audits:** The smart contract undergoes rigorous security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Immutable Code:** Core functionalities are immutable post-deployment, preventing unauthorized changes.

## Rewards and APY

COIN100 offers attractive rewards and Annual Percentage Yield (APY) to incentivize holding and providing liquidity.

### Rewards Distribution

- **Rewards Pool:** 5% of the total supply is allocated to the rewards pool.
- **Reward Mechanism:** A portion of each transaction fee is added to the rewards pool and distributed to holders based on their stake in eligible liquidity pools.
- **Dynamic Reward Rate:** The reward rate adjusts based on the token's price, ensuring sustainability and alignment with market conditions.

### Annual Percentage Yield (APY)

- **APY Calculation:** APY is determined by the reward rate and the total value locked (TVL) in eligible liquidity pools.
- **Example:** At a token price of $0.001 and a reward rate of 1000 C100 per day, the APY can reach up to 365,000% under optimal conditions. However, actual APY will vary based on market dynamics and reward rate adjustments.
- **Sustainability:** The dynamic rebase mechanism ensures that APY remains sustainable by adjusting the token supply and reward rates in response to market conditions.

### Liquidity Pool Incentives

- **Providing Liquidity:** Users can provide liquidity to eligible Uniswap pools and earn additional rewards.
- **Staking Rewards:** Liquidity providers receive staking rewards proportional to their contribution, enhancing their overall returns.
- **Boosted APY:** By participating in liquidity pools, users can significantly boost their APY through combined rewards and staking incentives.

### User Benefits

- **Passive Income:** Earn passive income through rewards and APY without active trading.
- **Diversification:** Gain exposure to the top 100 cryptocurrencies, reducing risk through diversification.
