COIN100 (C100) Token Overview
COIN100 (C100) is a decentralized cryptocurrency index fund built on the Polygon network. It represents the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, offering users a diversified portfolio that mirrors the performance of the overall crypto market. Inspired by traditional index funds like the S&P 500, COIN100 aims to dynamically track and reflect the top 100 cryptocurrencies, ensuring it remains a relevant and accurate representation of the cryptocurrency market.

Key Features
1. Decentralized Index Fund Representation
Purpose: COIN100 provides exposure to the top 100 cryptocurrencies without the need to individually purchase each one.
Benefit: Investors can diversify their crypto holdings with a single token, reducing risk associated with individual assets.
2. Rebase Mechanism
Functionality: The token supply adjusts (rebases) based on the total market capitalization of the top 100 cryptocurrencies.
Mechanism:
Increase in Market Cap: If the total market cap increases beyond a certain threshold, new tokens are minted and distributed.
Decrease in Market Cap: If the total market cap decreases, tokens are burned to reduce the supply.
Limitation: The maximum change per rebase is capped at 5% to prevent drastic supply fluctuations.
3. Chainlink Integration
Chainlink Functions: Used to fetch real-time market cap data from trusted external sources like CoinGecko.
Chainlink Automation: Automates the rebase process at predefined intervals (default is every 90 days).
4. Transaction Fees and Distribution
Total Fee: A fee is applied to each transaction.
Fee Breakdown:
Burn Fee (1.2%): Tokens are permanently removed from circulation, potentially increasing token value.
Reward Fee (0.6%): Added to the rewards pool for distribution to liquidity providers.
5. Rewards for Liquidity Providers
Eligibility: Users who provide liquidity to the COIN100/WMATIC pair on Uniswap V2.
Rewards:
Distributed from the rewards pool.
The reward rate adjusts based on the current token price to incentivize liquidity provision during different market conditions.
6. Adjustable Reward Rate
Dynamic Adjustment: The reward rate changes based on the token's market price to balance incentives.
Reward Tiers:
Below $1: Highest rewards to encourage buying and holding.
$1 - $5: Moderate rewards.
$5 - $10: Reduced rewards.
Above $10: Lowest rewards, reflecting increased token value.
7. Price Feed Mechanism
Chainlink Price Feeds: Fetches real-time price data for accurate calculations.
Flexible Source:
Direct Price Feed: Uses direct COIN100/USD price data if available.
Derived Price: Calculates price using Uniswap reserves and MATIC/USD price feed when direct data isn't available.
8. Uniswap Integration
Liquidity Pool: COIN100 is paired with WMATIC on Uniswap V2, enabling users to trade and provide liquidity.
Benefits:
Facilitates easy token swaps.
Allows liquidity providers to earn fees and rewards.
How COIN100 Works
Initialization:

The total supply is set at 1,000,000,000 C100 tokens.

COIN100 fetches the combined market cap of the top 100 cryptocurrencies using Chainlink Functions.
This data is used to adjust the token supply to mirror market movements.
Rebase Process:

Occurs at set intervals (default every 90 days).
If Market Cap Increases:
The token supply increases by minting new tokens (up to 5% per rebase).
If Market Cap Decreases:
Tokens are burned (up to 5% per rebase), reducing the supply.
Transaction Mechanics:

When tokens are transferred, a 3% fee is applied.
Fees are automatically split and allocated according to the fee breakdown.
Owner transfers are exempt from fees.
Rewards Distribution:

Liquidity providers earn rewards based on their share of the liquidity pool.
Rewards are calculated and distributed during each rebase cycle.
The reward rate adjusts according to the token's market price.
Providing Liquidity:

Users can provide liquidity by adding COIN100 and WMATIC to the Uniswap V2 pool.
In return, they receive LP tokens representing their share of the pool.
LP token holders are eligible for rewards and a portion of the trading fees.
